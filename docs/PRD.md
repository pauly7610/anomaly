## Project: Financial Transaction Anomaly Detection Dashboard

### Overview
A full-stack web application for uploading, analyzing, and visualizing synthetic financial transaction data with anomaly detection and advanced analytics.

### Goals
- Detect anomalous transactions in uploaded datasets
- Provide advanced analytics and data visualizations
- Enable secure, authenticated access
- Allow export of filtered data (CSV/PDF)

### Key Features
- Data upload (CSV/PDF)
- Dashboard with:
  - Transaction volume and anomaly rate over time
  - Top customers
  - Transaction type distribution
  - Largest transactions and recent anomalies
- Filtering by date range
- Authentication (login/register)
- Data export (CSV/PDF, filter-aware)

### Users
- Financial analysts
- Data scientists
- Business stakeholders

### Success Metrics
- Accurate anomaly detection
- Intuitive, responsive UI
- Secure, reliable data handling

### Out of Scope
