# Security Architecture

## Current Implementation
- JWT authentication with secure token handling
- Pydantic input validation preventing injection attacks
- PostgreSQL with parameterized queries
- Secure session management

## Enterprise Considerations
- Integration with bank SSO/LDAP systems
- Multi-tenant data isolation requirements
- SOX/PCI-DSS compliance logging
- Network segmentation for trading floor deployment
- Secrets management via bank's existing vault solutions

## Risk Assessment
- High-value target: Real-time financial data
- Regulatory requirements: SEC, FINRA audit trails
- Integration security: Must work within bank firewalls
